# Idea-Protocol
Testbed/Intro Project
=====================
The name's Jensen. Jensen Wang. Not really, but for all intents and purposes it's the moniker I intend to use online. Despite being a CS major, I've never had the proper time to check out GitHub or start any personal projects. Well, that changes with this Protocol. Nothing too serious, just dipping the toes in the water. The short-term goal is to create a personal website/platform from which I can expand into smaller projects, like a few startups I have an ideas for. We'll get into that later. In the meantime, let's just get this off the ground and see if it sticks.

I primarily work with Java, slight bits of Python, JavaScript, and C++ (I hope to make the transition soon).
